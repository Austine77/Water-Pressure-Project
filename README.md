Here's a **README.md** file for my Water Pressure Project:  

# **Water Pressure Project**

This project analyzes and calculates water pressure based on various physical parameters, such as water column height, pipe length, and fluid velocity. It includes functions to perform the calculations and test cases to ensure the program's accuracy.

## **Features**
- Calculate the height of the water column.
- Determine the pressure gain from the water height.
- Evaluate the pressure loss due to friction in pipes.
- Comprehensive test cases to validate the functionality using `pytest`.


## **Requirements**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- `pytest` for testing the program


## **Project Structure**
The project consists of the following files:

1. **`water_flow.py`**:  
   Implements the main functionality, including:
   - `water_column_height(tower_height, tank_height)`
   - `pressure_gain_from_water_height(height)`
   - `pressure_loss_from_pipe(pipe_diameter, pipe_length, friction_factor, fluid_velocity)`

2. **`test_water_flow.py`**:  
   Contains test cases to validate the functions in `water_flow.py`. Utilizes `pytest` to ensure correctness.


## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd water-pressure-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the calculations by importing functions from `water_flow.py` in your Python script or IDE.

2. Execute the test cases:
   ```bash
   python test_water_flow.py
   ```

3. Verify the output to ensure all test cases pass.

## **Function Details**

### 1. `water_column_height(tower_height, tank_height)`
Calculates the height of the water column based on the formula:  
\[ h = t + \left(\frac{3w}{4}\right) \]  
**Parameters**:  
- `tower_height`: Height of the tower.  
- `tank_height`: Height of the tank.  

**Returns**:  
- Water column height (in meters).  

---

### 2. `pressure_gain_from_water_height(height)`
Calculates pressure gain from the water height using the formula:  
\[ P = \frac{\rho \cdot g \cdot h}{1000} \]  
**Parameters**:  
- `height`: Height of the water column (in meters).  

**Returns**:  
- Pressure gain (in kPa).  

---

### 3. `pressure_loss_from_pipe(pipe_diameter, pipe_length, friction_factor, fluid_velocity)`
Evaluates pressure loss due to friction in a pipe using the formula:  
\[ P = -f \cdot L \cdot \rho \cdot v^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2000 \cdot d}\right) \]  
**Parameters**:  
- `pipe_diameter`: Diameter of the pipe (in meters).  
- `pipe_length`: Length of the pipe (in meters).  
- `friction_factor`: Friction factor (dimensionless).  
- `fluid_velocity`: Velocity of the fluid (in m/s).  

**Returns**:  
- Pressure loss (in kPa).

## **Testing**
- Run the test cases:
  ```bash
  python test_water_flow.py
  ```
- Example output:
  ```
